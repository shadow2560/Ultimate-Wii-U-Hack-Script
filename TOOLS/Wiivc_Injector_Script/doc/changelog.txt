2.2.6 modified v1.28B:
- Use UTF-8 encoding for and during the differents scripts.
- Implement an alternative method if games path have some unsuported letters for Wit. It's not a realy good method and I don't like it because it takes time to copy the game and the error verifications could take too mutch time compared to before but it's the only solution that I have found for now. Note that the "(" and the ")" characters always make the script exit with an error.
- Fix bug if "(" or ")" are entered in the differents path.
- Convert the Wii U Title Id to upper case if it is entered manualy.
- Fix bugs in the blacklist function of the Wiivc Injector Script and in the "blacklist_wiiu_instaled_titles.bat" script.

- Add possibility to use all format of images witch could be convert with ImageMagick. If you use the script with the method of copying some files in the "SOURCE_FILES" folder, you just have to respect the filename of the images (bootTvTex, iconTex, bootDrcTex and bootLogoTex) but you can use any extentions that you want (.jpg, .tga, .pdf, .tif, ...).

- Some other bugs fix.

2.2.6 modified v1.26B:
- Add possibility to define path of each files used during the script (game, images, bootsound, custom main.dol for Gamecube injection and cheats for Wii injection). If you could, try to not use dirrectories/files name witch have accents or special chars into them, especialy for Wii games because Wit don't like it ("+, -, [, ], _, (, ), space" are authorised). Note that the script could also be used as before, only path of eventual missing files in the SOURCE_FILES folder will be asked if you choose to enter sources manualy (except game file) and all of them could be empty.
- Add more verifications to delete some files at the end of the script.
- Some other bugs fix.

2.2.6 modified v1.25:
- Add suport of cheats injection for Wii games, you need a "game.gct" file into the "SOURCE_FILES" dirrectory. Note that this function is not stable and could cause the game to not function properly. The cheats couldn't be disabled on the created channel with this method of injection.
- Update "readme.txt" file.

2.2.6 modified v1.24:
- If repacking an Wii iso with Wit fail the first time, an other method is tried. With this, even if the iso is in fact a ciso or an other type of Wii game format (except multi wbfs files), the convertion should work.
- Move instructions for sources game deleting after Wit succesfuly repack the iso.

2.2.6 modified v1.23:
- The "bootTvTex.png" and "iconTex.png" are not anymore required files in the "SOURCE_FILES" dirrectory, they are now optionals. If they are not present, a generic image will be copied from "TOOLS\templates".
- Add possibility to download images of the game you want to inject via cucholix repository, see https://github.com/cucholix/wiivc-bis/tree/master/ to have more informations. The images are downloaded in the "SOURCE_FILES" dirrectory and are cleaned at the end of the script.
- Add a bootsound for Gamecube games and for the Nintendont auto-injection. The bootsound comes from cucholix repository and is located at "TOOLS\templates\GC_bootSound.wav".
- Title ID are now extracted via Wit for Gamecube and Wii games files.
- The Gamecube games can now be named "game.iso" because the script takes care of verifications for the type of game you try to inject and it's not all based on the name of gamefiles now. The second disc can also be named "disc2.iso". You can also name the first "game.iso" and the second "disc2.gcm" or the first one "game.gcm" and the second "disc2.iso", it haven't any impact from now because the script will change the extention of them to gcm.
- Changed how the script clean up files at the end of the convertion.
- Changed how the script terminate in case of errors. Now the temp files are cleaned when the script exit.
- Add some new verifications and some new errors messages.

- Add creation of the blacklist file if it not exists when the injection script begin.
- Bug fixed in GetExtTypePatcher instructions for Wii games.
- Implement injection of new formats of Wii disc type (.wdf, .wia, .ciso, .wbi). The name of the file should be, for example, "game.ciso" for ciso files (same apply for other format, only the file extension should be changed like "game.wia" for wia files, see the "readme.txt" file).
