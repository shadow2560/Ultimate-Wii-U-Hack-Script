  <short_description>Hacking vWii from WiiU Mode</short_description>
  <long_description>So this is something I wrote today which may be helpful to people who dont have a required game to hack vwii.

UPDATE: this update is one month after the initial release of v1.0, this is much simpler to do now with v1.1!
Grab the current elf release from the releases tab.
Download the hackmii installer and put only the boot.elf from that zip on your sd card root.
Make sure to unplug any and all usb devices before following any of these steps.
Put the wuphax.elf into your wiiu/apps folder on your sd card and run it in homebrew launcher.
Press A to back up your current mii channel and inject it with wuphax.
After the wiiu restarted, go into wii mode and run mii channel, install homebrew channel from there.
To restore the mii channel just run the elf again and press B this time.
