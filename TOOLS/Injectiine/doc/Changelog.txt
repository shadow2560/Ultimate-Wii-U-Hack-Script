- Bugs fix release.
V1.23 Modified FR V1.5 (14/01/18)
- If the images files in the "Files" folders are not in "png" format, all the scripts will convert them into it. Now the "MetaVerify" script is not needed anymore and it was removed.
- The question to pack the game or not is asked before the injecting process in all scripts.

V1.23 Modified FR V1.4 (12/01/18)
- Added base download with a custom Title ID and Title Key for all injections type. Be careful with this, no verifications are made and the scripts or injections could bug easily if bad informations are provided.
- The product code of the base used is automaticaly determined by using the "cos.xml" file for NES and SNES injection.
- The rom/ini name is automaticaly set, based on the rom name of the base, for the N64 injection. You can always provide your own name if you want. If the base doesn't contain a rom, you must set a name.
- Made some modification in the N64 script for INIs's files, now an INI file witch is present in a base and witch is not present in the "INIs" folder is copied into the "INIs" folder.
- Added "INIs" folder in the save configuration script.
- Tried to fix creation of a blank ini file in N64 injection.

- Del "RUN.bat" script because it's unusful now.
- Fixed GBA injection.
- Converting Python scripts to standard application ".exe", Python doesn't need to be installed anymore (all the consoles script have been updated to reflect this change).
- French translation.
- Create a "preload.bat" witch display a warning for the user to prevent a bad font use during the script.
- All scripts are now in UTF-8.
- Add files and folders selection with GUI if the user want to use it. The old manual copy process in the "Files" dirrectory always work and file selection is not asked if corresponding file is found in the "Files" folder.
